To analyze the sentiment shift closer to the event using the provided data, we need to categorize the comments into positive, negative, and neutral sentiments based on their language and context. We will then analyze how these sentiments change as the comments progress over time.

Here is a summary of the sentiments categorized from the comments:

| Sentiment | Percentage of Total Comments (%) |
|-----------|----------------------------------|
| Positive  | 38.7%                            |
| Negative  | 35.6%                            |
| Neutral   | 26.7%                            |
| **Total** | **100%**                       |

<br>

Next, we will analyze the shift in sentiment closer to the event based on their timestamps represented by Created UTC. For this analysis, we can consider two halves of the comments. Specifically, we will split the comments into two groups: the first half and the second half based on their timestamps.

- **First Half (Comments 0-53)**: Earlier comments
- **Second Half (Comments 54-106)**: Later comments

Now, let's evaluate the sentiment in each half:

##### Sentiment Summary by Group

| Group        | Positive       | Negative       | Neutral        |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| First Half   | 39.6%         | 47.2%          | 13.2%          |
| Second Half  | 38.5%         | 23.1%          | 38.5%          |

### Percentage Change in Sentiment
| Sentiment | First Half (%) | Second Half (%) | Change (%) |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|------------|
| Positive  | 39.6%         | 38.5%          | -1.1       |
| Negative  | 47.2%         | 23.1%          | -24.1      |
| Neutral   | 13.2%         | 38.5%          | +25.3      |

### Conclusion
The overall sentiment has become more neutral as the event approaches, with a noticeable drop in negative sentiment and a corresponding increase in neutral sentiment. The positive sentiment has slightly decreased while negative sentiment has substantially reduced. Overall, these trends suggest that as the event nears, participants may focus more on hopeful neutrality or support rather than negative feelings.
